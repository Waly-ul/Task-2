# Developing a RESTful API for a Task Management System

- Build a RESTful API for a task management system that supports CRUD operations for tasks (create, read, update, delete).

- Use Laravel's API resources to format responses consistently.

- Implement authentication for API endpoints using JWT.

- Include proper validation, error handling, and documentation (e.g., in the README or using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI).

# I used Laravel's own resource controller to solve the task. Below are the route identifiers:

## Auth Routes:

- POST `/api/register` - Register new user
- POST `/api/login` - Login and get JWT
- POST `/api/logout` - Logout (JWT Required)
- GET `/api/me` - Get authenticated user (JWT Required)

## Task Routes (JWT Required)

- GET `/api/tasks`
- POST `/api/tasks`
- GET `/api/tasks/{id}`
- PUT `/api/tasks/{id}`
- Delete `/api/tasks/{id}`

Each route has been checked with the postman, and all routes have run successfully. That is, the task has performed all operations: create, read, update, and delete.
